## Hello and welcome to my world :earth_americas:

I'm a Software Engineering Manager passionate about building loveable, reliable, and intuitive products. :rocket:

I like talking about programming, developer workflow, and software design principles. 👩🏽‍💻

I am motivated to help people and teams grow as they solve real-world technological challenges. 

I've been building real time trading applications :chart_with_upwards_trend: for the past 8 years. I know a few things about the financial domain.

All food :stew: everything excites me. I aim to eat at every 3 Michelin Star restaurants in the world. 

Spelling is my biggest weekness. :smile:

After hours you'll probably find me at your nearest boxing gym, punching some bags. 

> Keep an eye in this space for my musings, observations, and discussing my learnings.
